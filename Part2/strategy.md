## Momentum-based Strategy

The momentum strategy in this function uses a sliding window of the last three price updates to determine whether there is a strong, directional trend. When the price history contains exactly three prices, it assigns the oldest price to variable a, the next to b, and the most recent to c. It then checks whether these prices are strictly increasing—i.e. (a < b) and (b < c)—or strictly decreasing—i.e. (a > b) and (b > c). This simple check is used as a proxy for identifying momentum: if prices consistently move upward, it infers a bullish trend, and if they consistently move downward, it implies a bearish trend.

If either the up-trend or down-trend condition is met, the strategy considers that there is sufficient momentum to justify sending an order, and it does so after a short randomized delay. If the three prices do not demonstrate a clear monotonic trend, the strategy ignores the price update and waits for further data. This approach attempts to capture short-term momentum by reacting only when there's a clear and consistent change in direction over the recent updates. Note that when a momentum is observed (e.g. 3 consecutive increasing/decreasing prices), this strategy will keep hitting orders as long as the momentum keeps going (e.g. as long as prices keep increasing/decreasing).
